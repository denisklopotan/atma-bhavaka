<h1>Ātma-Bhāvaka - Express your Soul!</h1>

<details>
  <summary><h2>What is Ātma-bhāvaka?</h2></summary>
  <p>Atma Bhavaka is many things: It is a way to connect to an ancient and sacred part within
    ourselves. It is a way to experience a deep connection to the people around us. It is a way to
    release blocked emotions and receive therapeutic benefits. It is a way to become more playful
    and joyful by means of connecting to our inner child. It is a way of finding out inner voice and
    express it with all our heart, all our mind, and all our soul!
  </p>
  <p>Atma Bhavaka (a Sanskrit term for soul expression) is a group therapy approach which is rooted
      in ancient shamanic practices and has been shaped by insights and discoveries of modern
      psychology. Its three core elements are intuitive voice expression, spiritual-orientated
      framework and intuitive body movement. All three elements are used in various other therapy
      approaches and have a significant body of scientific evidence for its effectiveness in healing
      mental issues (more under “Science of Atma Bhavaka”).
  </p>
  <p>Yet in essence, Atma Bhavaka is a powerful and mystical experience and thus it is difficult to put
      its depth into words.
  </p>
  <p>Looking through the perspective of a child one may grasp its deeper meaning better for he or she
      knows intuitively how to be fully herself and how to express naturally and playfully what is
      happening inside of him.
  </p>
  <p>Looking through the lens of an animal, one may grasp its spirit for it lives only in the moment and
      just feels a depth of life that we humans sometimes fail to see, being so occupied with the
      understanding of this world through our rational minds.
  </p>
  <p>Connecting to the life of a plant, one may grasp its quality, for it connects and harmonizes
      effortlessly with other plants and beings.
  </p>
  <p>Yet again, none of them are able to fully live Atma-Bhavaka, for it is in the journey from the
      intelligent and rational mind, back into the depth of our hearts where we can truly express our
      soul!
  </p>
  <p>Atma-Bhavaka truly happens in a state of surrender to cosmos, to life, to the present moment. It
      happens when one allows every part of his own being, to be expressed in voice, movement and
      energy. It manifests as mystic and profoundly deep culmination of our shadow and our light, of
      our fear and love, of our body, mind and soul, into a divine orchestra that has the power to
      change us from the core of ourselves.

  <summary><h2>Roots of Ātma-bhāvaka</h2></summary>
  <h3><strong>Essential Part of Society</strong></h3>
  <p>The following tradition has been handed down by the Mbuti Pygmies in Africa:</p>
  <p>When a woman is pregnant, she goes to a remote place in nature with other women from the village. There they pray, meditate and listen until they hear the song of the unborn child. As soon as they recognize it, they begin to sing and repeat it until they can all sing the song. Then they go back to the village and teach it first to the father-to-be and then to all the other villagers. After the birth of the child, all the villagers gather around the newborn and welcome it to the earth with its song. During the rest of the person's life, this song is sung again and again during events such as initiations, losses, festivals, and marriages. At the end of his or her life, everyone gathers around him and sings her song as a farewell.</p>
  <p>To us in the West, practices such as Atma Bhavaka are rather unfamiliar, yet if we look into other societies, such as the Mbuti Pygmies, we can see how intuitive voice expression within a spiritual framework is an essential part of their culture and identity. Many similar examples can be found in native tribes around the world, yet also in religious societies such as Jewish, Sufis or Hindus, intuitive voice expression is often used to connect with God, to relieve suffering, and to strengthen social bonds.</p>
  <h3><strong>We All Have Done It</strong></h3>
  <p>When we were toddlers, we only had one possibility to deal with emotions which was to immediately express them into sound. If we had pain, this was a scream, if we were happy, a laughter, and if we explored the world around us we would give undefinable sounds and words to everything and express our mystic yet simple world to others.</p>
  <p>We therefore all intuitively know one of the key elements of Atma Bhavaka, which is to express whatever happens within us purely and innocently into the world.</p>
  <p>As we grew older, we have learned to hide and block our emotions which was needed to function in modern society. This technique seems helpful, especially when we have to present ourselves in a certain way to society or if we are faced with difficult and painful emotions that we prefer not to feel. Yet, if unattended, that ocean of hidden thoughts and emotions in us may overflow and leave us stranded at the shore of desperation and depression. In order to walk again, we have to embrace that ocean and fully express all its waves. In this way we can not only understand ourselves, but may joyfully ride the greatest waves and dive deep unto the core where we may meet a hidden and mystic part of ourselves&hellip;</p>
  <h3><strong>Nada Brahman - Everything is Sound</strong></h3>
  <p>In the texts of oldest world religion Hinduism (Rg Veda &amp; Mandukya Upanishad), Nada Brahman refers to the philosophical idea that the universe in its essence is sound-vibration, and that its origin is the cosmic sound Om. Likewise, the Bible refers to sound-vibration as the origin ofcreation (John 1:1:"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>Yet the roots of Atma Bhavaka are even seen in nature, in all animals and plants itself&hellip;</p>

  <summary><h2>The Science behind it</h2></summary>
  <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mental and Physical Health Benefits of Intuitive Voice Expression, Intuitive Body Movement, and Spiritual Orientated Methods</strong></span></h3>
  <p>The three core elements of Atma Bhavaka are intuitive voice expression, spiritual-orientated framework and intuitive body movement. For all three elements exists significant scientific evidence for its positive effect on mental, physical and social health. All three elements are therefore used in a large variety of therapeutic approaches.</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li><strong>Intuitive voice expression</strong> refers to the spontaneous, non-verbal use of one's voice (e.g., humming, chanting, toning, or even primal screaming) as a means of emotional and psychological release, self-regulation, and communication. The practice leverages the voice's natural ability to express emotion and impact physical states without structured musical training.</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive body movement</strong> refers to the practice of engaging in spontaneous, unstructured, and free-flowing physical movements that are guided by an individual&rsquo;s inner emotional state, body awareness, and impulses, rather than by external instructions or structured choreography. This form of movement is typically used to help individuals express feelings and experiences that may be difficult to articulate through words, making it a powerful tool for emotional healing, self-regulation, and mind-body integration.</li>
  <li><strong>Spiritual-oriented Framework</strong> refers to the integration of spiritual or religious beliefs, practices, and values into the therapeutic process to support a person's emotional, mental, and sometimes physical healing. This framework recognizes spirituality as an essential dimension of a person&rsquo;s identity and well-being and works to address concerns related to meaning, purpose, connection, and existential issues.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>1. Mental Health Benefits</strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Emotional Regulation and Stress Relief</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Voice Expression:</strong> vocal improvisation, such as humming or chanting, has been shown to regulate emotions and alleviate stress by promoting mindfulness and body awareness. A 2017 study in Frontiers in Psychology reported reduced anxiety and heightened emotional resilience through voice expression, similar to mindfulness practices.</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Body Movement:</strong> Movement-based therapies like dance have significant effects on emotional regulation. Free-form, intuitive movement allows individuals to express emotions physically, leading to improved self-awareness. A 2015 study in Frontiers in Psychology found that intuitive body movement fosters emotional expression when verbal communication may fail.</li>
  <li><strong>Spirituality:</strong> Spiritual practices such as meditation and prayer also provide a buffer against stress. A meta-analysis in Psychological Bulletin (2015) noted that spiritual practices lower depression and anxiety by instilling a sense of purpose and connection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Reduction in Anxiety and Depression</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Voice Expression:</strong> Vocal toning and chanting can reduce symptoms of depression by creating a sense of emotional connectedness. A 2013 study in The Arts in Psychotherapy found that these vocalizations help individuals connect with their emotional state, reducing feelings of isolation .</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Body Movement:</strong> Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) has been widely researched for its impact on anxiety reduction. Studies show that movement fosters the release of endorphins, improving mood and reducing depression .</li>
  <li><strong>Spirituality:</strong> Spiritual engagement has been consistently linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression. The Journal of Religion and Health (2019) highlighted how spiritual practices offer emotional regulation and resilience, buffering individuals against depressive episodes .</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>2. Physical Health Benefits</strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Respiratory, Cardiovascular, and Immune System Health</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Voice Expression:</strong> Voice practices like chanting and humming engage diaphragmatic breathing, improving respiratory and cardiovascular health. Research in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2012) found that these vocalizations reduced blood pressure and improved heart rate variability .</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span><strong>ntuitive Body Movement:</strong> Intuitive dance and free movement enhance physical fitness by improving balance, flexibility, and cardiovascular health. Studies show that regular dance participation helps prevent chronic conditions like heart disease and hypertension .</li>
  <li><strong>Spirituality:</strong> Studies on spirituality and health suggest improved cardiovascular outcomes for those who engage in religious or spiritual practices. For example, Circulation (2011) found that regular spiritual practice reduced the risk of heart disease . Additionally, research in The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004) linked spiritual engagement to enhanced immune function .</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Neuroplasticity and Pain Management</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Voice Expression:</strong> Voice improvisation stimulates cognitive flexibility and neuroplasticity. A 2016 study in NeuroImage showed how voice expression activates brain regions related to creativity and problem-solving . Moreover, sound vibrations can stimulate the vagus nerve, aiding in pain management .</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Body Movement:</strong> Engaging in dance not only promotes physical fitness but also helps in pain management. Studies have found that movement-based therapies reduce the perception of pain by fostering the release of endorphins .</li>
  <li><strong>Spirituality:</strong> Meditation and mindfulness, common spiritual practices, also contribute to pain management. A study in Nature Reviews Neuroscience (2015) reported that regular meditation decreases stress hormones like cortisol, which are often associated with chronic pain .</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>3. Social and Communicative Benefits</strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Social Bonding and Connectedness</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Voice Expression:</strong> Group singing and vocalization create social cohesion by synchronizing participants' physiological states, reducing feelings of loneliness. A 2017 study by Dingle et al. demonstrated how collective singing enhances social connectedness, vital for mental health .</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Body Movement:</strong> Group dance fosters a strong sense of community and belonging. The Journal of Happiness Studies (2018) reported that synchronized group dance increases feelings of euphoria and social bonding .</li>
  <li><strong>Spirituality:</strong> Religious or spiritual communities provide critical social support networks. This support reduces feelings of isolation and promotes a sense of purpose, which is linked to greater overall mental well-being .</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Body Image and Self-Esteem</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Body Movement:</strong> Dance can positively impact body image and self-esteem by shifting focus from appearance to body movement. Studies in Body Image (2015) found that participants in dance programs reported higher levels of body satisfaction and acceptance .</li>
  <li><strong>Spirituality:</strong> Spiritual engagement also fosters a positive sense of self, as individuals often find meaning and self-worth through their spiritual beliefs and practices. This can enhance overall self-esteem and contribute to better mental health outcomes .</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>4. Coping with Trauma and Chronic Illness</strong></h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Voice Expression:</strong> Voice expression is an effective tool in somatic and trauma healing. The body-mind connection facilitated by vocalization helps individuals "voice out" trauma stored in the body. Research by Levine and Ogden supports the use of voice expression in trauma therapy to aid emotional release .</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Body Movement:</strong> Dance Movement Therapy is similarly beneficial in trauma recovery, as it allows for non-verbal emotional expression and body-mind integration. Studies in Traumatology (2018) demonstrate how movement-based therapies help trauma survivors reconnect with their bodies and reduce PTSD symptoms .</li>
  <li><strong>Spirituality:</strong> Spiritual practices offer critical support for individuals coping with chronic illness. A study in Annals of Behavioral Medicine (2014) found that spiritual beliefs provided cancer patients with better emotional resilience and pain management .</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Here is a list of other therapeutic approaches which use the three named elements of spiritual orientation, intuitive voice expression, and intuitive body movement.</strong></span></h3>
  <h3><strong>1. Therapies Using Intuitive Voice Expression</strong></h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Stemexpressie and Urzang:</strong><br />Stemexpressie is an approach developed by Marius Engelbrecht who has established his work over 30 years ago in Den Haag, Netherlands. It combines the three elements of spiritual orientation, intuitive voice expression and intuitive body movement. Jarin van Emmichoven has accomplished a two year apprenticeship in Stemexpressie.<br />Urzang is another variation of the same approach, taught and practiced by Martin van Emmichoven in Berlin, Germany.</li>
  <li><strong>Voice Movement Therapy (VMT):</strong> <br />This therapy integrates voice, movement, and breath work to explore emotional expression and personal growth. Clients engage in spontaneous vocalization (e.g., humming, chanting) and body movement to access and release emotions, with an emphasis on intuitive voice expression.</li>
  <li><strong>Sound Therapy:</strong> <br />While sound therapy can take many forms, some approaches focus on intuitive vocalization, where clients use their voice to create sounds, tones, or chants that are meant to promote healing. This form of therapy emphasizes the therapeutic effects of sound vibrations on the body and emotions.</li>
  <li><strong>Music Therapy:</strong> <br />In music therapy, intuitive voice expression (improvised singing, toning, or chanting) can be used as part of the therapeutic process. Clients engage in spontaneous vocal sounds to explore emotional states, regulate mood, or express difficult-to-articulate feelings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>2. Therapies Using Intuitive Body Movement</strong></h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Dance Movement Therapy (DMT): </strong><br />DMT is a psychotherapeutic use of movement to support emotional, cognitive, and physical integration. It encourages clients to use intuitive, unstructured movements to express emotions and explore their inner worlds, facilitating healing through the body.</li>
  <li><strong>Somatic Experiencing (SE): </strong><br />A trauma-focused therapy developed by Peter Levine, SE uses intuitive body movements and physical awareness to help individuals release trauma stored in the body. It encourages clients to listen to their bodies and engage in natural movements that can help restore balance and emotional regulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentic Movement: </strong><br />A therapeutic practice where individuals engage in spontaneous, intuitive body movements in a safe, non-judgmental environment. It is often used to explore unconscious emotions, thoughts, and impulses through the body, allowing for deeper self-awareness and healing.</li>
  <li><strong>Five Rhythms&reg;: </strong><br />A movement-based therapeutic practice that encourages intuitive and free-form dance. Developed by Gabrielle Roth, it focuses on five different movement rhythms (Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical, and Stillness) to promote emotional expression, self-awareness, and healing.</li>
  <li><strong>Ecstatic Dance: </strong><br />A form of unstructured dance that allows participants to freely express themselves through movement. It is often used in a therapeutic or spiritual context to promote emotional release, connection, and mindfulness.</li>
  <li><strong>Body Psychotherapy: </strong><br />This form of therapy integrates body awareness with psychological healing. It often involves spontaneous or intuitive movements to help clients release emotional blockages, express feelings, and foster a deeper mind-body connection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>3. Spiritually Oriented Therapeutic Approaches</strong></h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Transpersonal Therapy: </strong><br />A therapeutic approach that focuses on the spiritual aspects of the human experience, helping clients achieve self-transcendence and personal growth. It integrates spiritual and existential elements, such as meditation, mindfulness, and spiritual exploration, into psychotherapy to promote healing.</li>
  <li><strong>Logotherapy: </strong><br />Developed by Viktor Frankl, logotherapy emphasizes finding meaning and purpose in life, particularly in the face of suffering. It encourages clients to explore their spiritual beliefs and existential questions as part of their psychological healing process.</li>
  <li><strong>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT): </strong><br />While not inherently religious, MBCT draws from Buddhist practices like mindfulness meditation. It integrates mindfulness techniques to help clients manage depression, anxiety, and stress by encouraging a present-moment focus, fostering a spiritual connection to oneself and the world.</li>
  <li><strong>Pastoral Counseling: </strong><br />A form of therapy that integrates psychological and theological principles, typically provided by a licensed therapist with religious or spiritual training. Pastoral counselors work with clients to address emotional and spiritual challenges, often incorporating prayer and religious practices.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Therapy:</strong> <br />A holistic therapeutic approach that addresses the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions of a person. It often incorporates spiritual practices like meditation and mindfulness, focusing on aligning the body, mind, and spirit for overall well-being.</li>

  <summary><h2>Where Science meets Spirituality</h2></summary>
  <p>A yet ancient practice that becomes more and more acknowledged for its power to heal mental issues and bring balance and joy into our life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is rooted on the principle that everything is in its essence energy. The ancient Rishis of Hinduism named it Nada Brahman (the world is sound?), as they discovered how all matter is in essence energy that is vibrating in a certain frequency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This resembles modern discoveries from quantum physic&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Dr. Masaru Emoto, a Japanese author and researcher, is known for his work on the concept that water can react to positive or negative words, sounds, and intentions. His findings are often discussed in the context of his book "The Hidden Messages in Water" and several follow-up works. Here are some key points about Dr. Emoto's findings:&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Practical Implications: Emoto's findings were often interpreted as evidence of the interconnectedness of consciousness and physical reality. He suggested that this understanding could have practical implications, such as using positive thoughts and intentions to improve health and well-being.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3><strong>Water Crystals and Music</strong></h3>
  <p>Dr. Masaru Emoto's experiments on water crystals primarily involved freezing water samples and then photographing the ice crystals that formed. He claimed that the formation of these crystals varied significantly depending on the type of external stimuli the water was exposed to before freezing. The stimuli included:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Words: Emoto exposed water samples to written words, spoken words, and even names. He reported that water exposed to positive words like "love" and "gratitude" formed well-defined, aesthetically pleasing crystals. In contrast, water exposed to negative words like "hate" and "fear" formed less structured, more chaotic crystals.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Music: Similarly, Emoto's experiments with music involved playing different genres of music near the water samples. Classical music, such as Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony," reportedly led to the formation of beautiful crystals. In contrast, more aggressive music, such as heavy metal, was said to result in less defined and less attractive crystal formations.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Images and Symbols: Emoto also claimed that exposing water to images, such as photographs of natural scenery, or symbols, like the symbol for peace, resulted in the formation of visually appealing crystals.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The process involved freezing the water quickly, which allowed for the formation of ice crystals. These were then observed under a microscope and photographed. Emoto and his team would select crystals they deemed representative of the water sample's reaction to the given stimulus.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Intent and Energy</strong></h3>
  <p>Dr. Emoto extended his research to explore the idea that human consciousness, including thoughts and intentions, could influence the physical properties of water. This aspect of his work is often summarized as the "power of positive thinking."&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Intentions and Words: Emoto proposed that positive intentions, blessings, and prayers directed toward water could enhance its molecular structure, resulting in the formation of beautiful crystals. Conversely, negative intentions or words were believed to disrupt the water's structure, leading to less harmonious crystal forms.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Concept of Hado: Emoto introduced the concept of "hado," a Japanese term he used to describe the intrinsic vibrational pattern of all things. He suggested that everything, including water, has its own hado, which can be influenced by external factors like words, music, and thoughts. Emoto believed that the vibrations from human emotions and intentions could interact with the hado of water, thereby affecting its crystalline structure.&nbsp;</p>
